brightness - the brightness setting can adjust your brightness at a much higher and lower rate than the regular ingame brightness, thats why it was added.
if it's set to -1, it will use your ingame brightness bar to adjust your brightness, only change it from -1 if setting to the max brightness ingame is not bright enough, or you want to fine tune it more than the ingame setting can provide
this also fixes brightness not working in Windows 8

mousefix - this setting fixes a windows 8 only problem of sometimes after an alt tab being able to see the mouse cursor over GTA:SA, disable if you're not using windows 8
shadows - enable or disables volumetric shadows, AKA the shitty shadows that lag even the best of PC's. run your game on very high FX quality without those shadows that looked ugly, and lagged your game anyway!
